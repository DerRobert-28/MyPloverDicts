==========================
Plover Regenpfeifer
==========================

Regenpfeifer (German stenography system) support for Plover.

For now it only remaps the top S- to Z- but it is planned to add orthography rules in the future.

In the versions lower than 1.0.0, -Z was remapped to -N but this was reverted as described on https://stenoblog.com/regenpfeifer-layout-update/.

The dictionary is generated with the corresponding version of https://github.com/mkrnr/regenpfeifer using the word list from https://github.com/mkrnr/wortformliste.

Recommended Usage
-----------------

Since the regenpfeifer dictionary will change in the future, it it highly recommended to create a separate dictionary with your own mappings.
